# Question given in the Task
Write a SQL query that performs this sampling and creates the expected output ordered by image_id with integer columns image_id, weak_label




# Steps Taken To Solve The Task


1) Created a Task Database.
2) Using the Task Database.
3) Created  Table and the columns and inserted the values in the table.
4) Used Window Function (row_number()) to give unique identifier for entire window.
5) Order Did in desc for positive images ans asc for negative images based on score.
6) For positive images fetching the images starting from first and taking every third image.
7) Similarly for negative images.
8) Created a view for both positive and negative images 
9) Combined at the end with help of union to get the result for both positive and negative.
